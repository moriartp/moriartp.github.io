    <h3>Teenage Wastelands</h3>
    <p>Various reports in recent years have looked at the different ways adolescents in the United States get high. Whether it is <a href="http://6abc.com/health/investigation-teens-getting-high-on-easy-to-get-drugs/525260/">Triple C or Robo-tripping</a> (different ways of getting hallucinogenic highs off household products, <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5061674 ">the rise of Oxytcontin use</a> among U.S teens, or marked <a href="http://www.jhnewsandguide.com/news/cops_courts/heroin-addiction-on-the-rise/article_1f949164-4194-504f-86ab-eb6aa449c2da.html">increases in the use of heroin</a> among adolescents, teen drug use persists as a troubling, and highly problematic epidemic</p>
    <p>The availability and public perception of different drugs change, making it difficult to compare the drug use of a given age group over time. We were, however, able to analyze a 2012 survey on drug use from the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Data Archive (SAMHDA) to see a snapshot of what drugs adolescents were taking at that articular point in time. Are their patterns of use different from other age groups? How similar are people within the adolescent cohort when it comes to drug use?</p>
    <p>Not surprisingly, adolescents aged 12 to 20 have lower rates of drug use overall than their Early Adult contemporaries. Alcohol and marijuana were the most commonly used drugs among all age groups. For Adolescents, the next in line was prescription pain relievers, with over 6 percent saying they’d used one for non-prescription purposes at least once in the previous year. </p>

    <h3>Frequency of use in days adolescents aged 12-20 who said in a 2012 survey that they had used the following drugs in the past year</h3>
    <div id="bars2" class="bar"></div>
    <p>The use of some drugs may be less common among adolescents than other age groups, but it’s still surprisingly frequent for users in the 20 and under crowd. The median pot-smoking adolescnets got high 43 days in a year, only slightly less often than 35- to 49-year-olds (48 days) For all age groups over 21, including the baby-boomers, the reported median use among drinkers was the nearly twice as much: 52 days, whereas adolescnets reported a median of 23 days.</p>
    <p>While the painkiller category on the survey represents dozens of different prescription drugs, an additional set of questions asked specifically about one of the most common and problematic drugs from an addiction and abuse standpoint: OxyContin. We found that just about 1 percent of adolescents said they’d used OxyContin in the previous year. Still, given the extremely addictive and deadly nature of the drug, any illicit use is cause for concern.</p>
