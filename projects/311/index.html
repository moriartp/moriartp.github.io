    <p>For many, Christmas time is a time to close ranks with family. As we do so, we can become somewhat disconnect to the lives and activities of those all around us during the holidays. The insights yielded from this study illustrate some of what other New Yorkers are up to on Christmas morning, who needs help, what what needs attention. The information detailed in the visualizations details 311 call data on Christmas day from 12:00 AM through 11:59:59 PM. And shows us just what gets the attention of New Yorkers on the holidays.</p>
    <p>Perhaps not surprisingly, the day gets off to a raucus start, as Christmas Eve revelers hit the streets in the early morning hours, prompting a swell of complaints about noise volumes on the city's sidewalks, and noisy vehicles hitting the streets. Well, that and one or more large rodents terrorizing New Yorkers got the bulk of the attention in tHE early morning hours</p>

    <p>As New Yorkers arose from thier long winter's nap, many found that they had no heat or hot water, as early to midday 311 calls yielded higher numbers of complaints related to heat and hot water services. While others hit the roads, a number of them found the street conditions insuited for passage, showing a spike in calls about "Street Condition" as the day got underway</p>
    <p>As the day progresses we see an increase in calls regarding "Unsanitary Conditions" at around 3:00:00 PM, but the day is dominated by calls about vehicles. As New Yorkers, particularly in outer boroughs welcome visitors, parking becomes a problem and many driveways are blocked and illegal parking surges. At night, we again see Christmas revelers hit the streets, making noise and prompting a new surge in 311 calls about noise.</p>
